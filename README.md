# C# Automated Test Framework for the Sparta Global Profiles App

## Tools and Technologies
I have used Selenium WebDriver, SpecFlow, NUnit and Visual Studio to build the framework and run 
the tests.

## What Went Well
The purpose of this project was to help me gain some understanding of C# and expand my range of 
experiences as a tester. I definitely feel as though I have accomplished this goal.

## Challenges
I am completely new to the C# language: so even though I am a confident test engineer, it has 
been a huge challenge swapping languages from Ruby to C#!

## In a future iteration of this project...
- I would love to improve the framework by implementing a library of random information to be 
generated for each test.
- I want to make the framework more object-orientated by using a Page Object Model and a Base 
Class.
